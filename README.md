# Rarity Tooltips

This datapack customises item tooltips to reflect their rarity. [Affected items](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Rarity#Upcoming_for_Java_Edition_1.21.2_and_Bedrock_Edition_1.21.30)

⚠️ **Will only work for 24w36a and newer, resource pack is required.**

![Bottle o' Enchanting (uncommon), Music Disc (rare), Silence Armour Trim (epic)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/1acc80622268a13c6351ac09887679aba3e6ad70.png)

### Help
If you are using this on a server, paste the resource pack download link after ``resource-pack=`` in the ``server.properties`` file.

Most items will just work but for some you will need to drop them on the ground to change them, for example if you enchant/disenchant an item or items from before the pack was installed.
