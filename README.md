# Rarity Tooltips

This datapack changes the tooltips of items to match their rarity.

⚠️ **Will only work for 24w36a and newer, resource pack is required.**

### Help
If you are using this on a server, paste the resource pack download link after ``resource-pack=`` in the ``server.properties`` file.

Most items will just work but for some you will need to drop them on the ground to change them, for example if you enchant/disenchant an item.

If you install this datapack in an existing world, you can use ``/trigger rt_fix_toggle`` to fix items on the ground in a 5 block radius of yourself, this will toggle per person. You _should_ only need to use this for items obtained before installing the datapack.

### Issues/Feature Requests
Please report issues or request features on the github issues page, any help is greatly appreciated.

### Other
Please feel free to create resource packs to change the textures of the tooltips for this datapack, I will link to them on this page.
